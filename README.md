# Equivalence-Verification-of-Digital-Circuits

This is my project for performing equivalence  Verification for the Testing and Verification of Digital Circuits class.

In this project, the equivalence  verification of two circuits is performed by computing Groebner basis in boolean rings using zero suppressed Binary decision diagrams. The code is implemented in C.
