# Equivalence-Verification-of-Digital-Circuits

This is my project for performing Equivalanece Verification for the Testing and Verification of Digital Circuits class.

In this project, the euivalence verification of two circuits is performed by computing Grobner basis in boolean rings uisng zero 
suppressed binary decision diagrams. The code is implemented in C.
